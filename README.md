# Haochen's Collection of Utilities programmed in Java

This project hosts the utilities written in Java by Haochen. Those utilities are
written for different reasons and each of them are not significant enough to be
hosted in its own project.

Different utilities are organized in different Java packages, and some generic
utilities are residing in the *.jutilities.utilities package.

There is also a GUI entry point, the name.haochenxie.jutilities.app.Gui class,
which will give a list of utilities accessible with its own GUI.
